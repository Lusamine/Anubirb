# FAQ

### How did you get these files?  
These were all dumped directly from the game using CFW.

### Are they all legal/legitimate?  
All of these files were dumped from an unmodified stock game except for the shiny Zacian directory, which used a ROM edit to remove the shiny lock for science. They are intended to be used to answer questions about the game's mechanics empirically. If you edit anything here, it is by definition "not legitimate."

### Why are some files missing met location and trainer data?  
Many wild encounters are dumped from RAM and the Pokémon was never captured to save time. This still allows for analysis of all other traits except for a few which are generated after capture. For example, Mark data is available on partial files for all marks except Curry Mark.

### Can I use these files?  
Feel free to use them for whatever reason, be it research or templates for Pokémon edits. Please use this resource responsibly.

### Can I contribute files?  
I prefer to keep this limited to my own files since I know how they were obtained, but we can discuss if you have something interesting.

### Can I request a particular encounter to be added?  
Yes, as long as it's easy to automate sampling.
