## FAQ

### How did you get these files?  
These were all dumped directly from the game using CFW, and can serve as examples of Pokémon encountered through these methods.

### Are they all legal?  
All of them are from an unmodified game except for the encounters for shiny Zacian.

### Why are some of them missing met location and trainer data?  
Many wild encounters are dumped from RAM and the Pokémon was never captured to save time.  This still allows for analysis of all other traits except for a few such as Pokérus, memory, met location, and OT information which are generated after capture.

### Can I use these files?  
Feel free to use them for whatever reason, be it research or templates for Pokémon edits.  Please do not use this resource to deceive others.  If you find out something interesting, let me know!

### Can I contribute files?  
I prefer to keep this limited to my own files since I know how they were obtained.  But we can discuss if you have something interesting.
